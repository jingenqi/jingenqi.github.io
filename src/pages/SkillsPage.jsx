## About Me

I'm a software engineer with hands-on experience in full-stack development, machine learning, and data engineering. My journey spans from building production e-commerce systems to developing predictive models for manufacturing quality control.

## Professional Experience

Currently working as a Data Engineer at Outlier, focusing on LLM evaluation and model improvement through data annotation. I've led coding and mathematics projects while hosting training webinars for teams across different time zones.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at Shangu Cyber Security, where I managed and optimized databases on Kylin OS and implemented virtualization technologies. I also built scalable data pipelines and analytics dashboards at Saint Laurent Consulting, creating COVID-19 trend analysis systems that automated 95% of manual data collection.

## Technical Focus

I'm drawn to projects where technology solves real problems. Whether it's improving manufacturing processes through predictive modelling or building systems that scale, I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the technical challenges and the business needs.

My experience spans from low-level system administration to high-level machine learning, which gives me a good sense of where bottlenecks hide and how different pieces fit together. I approach problems methodically but stay flexible when the data tells a different story.

## What I Build

I've developed full-stack e-commerce systems using Django and React, implemented RESTful APIs with Java Spring Boot, and created machine learning models that improved prediction accuracy by 15-20%. I'm particularly interested in how AI systems can be made more reliable and how machine learning can solve practical engineering problems.

When I'm not working on client projects, I'm probably tinkering with new frameworks or contributing to open source projects.
